# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning techniques. It processes transaction data, applies feature engineering, and trains models to classify fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions. Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) using a CSV dataset, with models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

🔍 Overview:
<br>
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. Given a dataset of transactions, the model identifies patterns to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Fraud detection is critical in financial security, preventing unauthorized transactions and reducing losses for businesses and consumers.
