# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-TensorFlow-in-Python
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the development and evaluation of various machine learning models for SMS spam detection using TensorFlow in Python. 


# Project Overview
This project involves the development and comparison of several machine learning models for detecting SMS spam. The Jupyter notebook included in this repository utilizes TensorFlow in Python to implement and evaluate four distinct models:

- Multinomial Naive Bayes: Serves as the baseline model.
- Custom Vector Embeddings Model: Utilizes tailored text vectorization techniques.
- Bidirectional LSTM Model: Employs a deep learning approach for sequence processing.
- USE (Universal Sentence Encoder) Transfer Learning Model: Leverages pre-trained models for enhanced performance.

Each model is evaluated based on its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with results visualized for easy comparison.
