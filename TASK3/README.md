# Customer Churn Prediction Project

[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)


## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to stop using a service, enabling proactive retention efforts. The entire workflow, from data exploration to model evaluation, is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python and popular data science libraries.

## Motivation

Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. By building an accurate churn prediction model, businesses can:

* Identify at-risk customers.
* Implement targeted retention strategies.
* Reduce customer attrition.
* Improve overall business profitability.

## Jupyter Notebook (`customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`)

The core of this project is the Jupyter Notebook, which encompasses the following key stages:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Loading the dataset (assumed to be in `your_dataset.csv`) and performing initial exploratory data analysis to understand its structure, features, and target variable ('Churn'). This includes visualizing data distributions and identifying potential issues like missing values.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the data for machine learning models. This involves:
    * Handling missing values (e.g., imputation).
    * Encoding categorical features (using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding).
    * Scaling numerical features (using StandardScaler).
3.  **Feature Engineering (Optional):** Creating new features from existing ones to potentially improve model performance. An example implemented is grouping customer tenure.
4.  **Model Selection and Training:** Training and comparing the performance of several classification models:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Random Forest Classifier
    * Gradient Boosting Classifier
5.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained models on a held-out test set using various metrics:
    * Accuracy
    * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
    * Confusion Matrix (visualized as a heatmap)
    * Feature Importance (for tree-based models, visualized as bar plots)
6.  **Visualization of Results:** Utilizing libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations, including:
    * Distribution of the target variable.
    * Confusion matrices for each model.
    * Feature importance plots.
    * Correlation heatmap of features.
7.  **Interpretation and Conclusion:** Summarizing the findings, comparing model performances, and discussing the potential implications of the results.

## Key Findings (Example - Replace with your actual findings)

* The **Gradient Boosting Classifier** demonstrated the highest accuracy on the test set (e.g., 80%).
* Key features influencing churn, as identified by tree-based models, include **contract type, tenure, and monthly charges**.
* The confusion matrices highlight the types of errors each model makes, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing, and model evaluation)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook
* Feature Engineering
* Model Selection and Training
* Model Evaluation (Classification Metrics, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC - *if implemented*)
* Data Visualization

## How to Run the Code

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/arnav-ds/customer-churn-prediction.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git)
    ```
2.  Ensure you have the required libraries installed. It's recommended to create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` in your project directory after installing the necessary libraries.)
3.  Place your dataset file named `your_dataset.csv` in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. **Note:** If your dataset has a different name or location, update the file loading part in the notebook.
4.  Open and run the `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

This project assumes the use of a customer churn dataset in CSV format (`your_dataset.csv`)(Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle). The dataset should contain features relevant to customer behavior and a target variable indicating whether a customer has churned or not.

## Potential Improvements and Next Steps

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Implement techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the performance of the chosen models.
* **Advanced Feature Engineering:** Explore more sophisticated feature creation techniques based on domain knowledge.
* **Model Interpretability:** Apply techniques like LIME or SHAP to better understand the predictions of more complex models.
* **Deployment (Conceptual):** Outline potential deployment strategies for a real-world application.
* **Monitoring:** Discuss how the model's performance could be monitored over time.
* **Explore Other Models:** Experiment with additional machine learning algorithms.
